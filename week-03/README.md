Toby is a curious guy, who wants to be a webdev.
He would like to create a webpage for raising awareness of eating fresh.
He has a design in mind and made a sketch.
He also found a cool library he wants to use, which is close to what he needs.
Wrote the html file and imported the library, all fine.
BUT!
He got stuck.
He doesn't really know css yet, only some basic stuff. Classes or ids neither.
The only class he used was on a list element, because he saw it in a tutorial.
As for the font-size, he also copied from that tut. Doesn't even know what's rem...

He asked you to:
Help him make that page look as similar to the design as possible 'sketch.png'.
However, he is proud of his work, so you are not allowed to touch it.
Additionally, he wants to keep that cool library, because it has nice colors.
So no file renamings, no dirty tricks, edit only the contents of 'your-code.css'.

Good luck ^.^
