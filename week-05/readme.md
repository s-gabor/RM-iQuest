# HTML & CSS Templating challenge

### Design the carrot store's site

---
#### Requirements

In this challenge you are to build a website of 3 pages for a carrot store.
- The **homepage** contains mainly the company name and motto.
- The user can navigate from there to the **products view**, showing all the carrots.
- The **product details** is accessible through clicking the "more" button on a list element.

Try to implement it both ways:
1) Using only CSS and HTML written by you (and the provided resources of course).
2) Writing a minimal amount of code and using an external library.

The two should be saved in different folders, being two separate sites.  
You are allowed to use any technique discussed so far as long as you get the job done.  
*note: You do not have to create a page for every carrot. One is enough.*

**BONUS:**  
Make the site responsive.
