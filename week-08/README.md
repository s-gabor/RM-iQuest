## Requirements

* As a user I would like to insert values inside the input fields from the web page and get the results in the place where the parantheses are
* The inserted text should be only of type int even if the input is of type text - make a validation ;)
* The result should be displayed in the DOM at the node where the parantheses are
* The same applies for error
